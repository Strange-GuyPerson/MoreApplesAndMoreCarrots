### A Minecraft mod that adds more apples and more carrots. 

More Apples and More Carrots is a mod that expands on the food options in Minecraft by adding new types of apples and carrots, fitting in with vanilla Minecraft's enchanted golden apples, regular golden apples, and golden carrots. You can now get different "tiers" of apples and carrots that are made from various materials, like wood, stone, iron, diamond, and netherite. Apples come in both regular and enchanted variants, while there are only regular, unenchanted carrots. This is done in order to improve consistency, as enchanted golden carrots also do not exist in vanilla Minecraft. This mod also adds a creative mode exclusive apple: the God Apple, which grants the player overpowered buffs when consumed. 

Support for more game versions and a Fabric port will be added in the future. However, I will **not** be porting this mod to Minecraft versions below 1.20, and I will **not** be making a Forge port of this mod. Support for more languages are also coming soon! 

# Items

## Apples

Below are all the apple variants added by this mod, with enchanted apples essentially being an upgraded version of their unenchanted counterparts. Depending on the tier, some apples will give the player a status effect on consumption.
